                            These printed materials were part of a change management campaign for a client with a diverse employee
                            population located in warehouses, storefronts, and offices across Canada. The client was changing the
                            delivery of their associates' pay stubs and tax forms to an online portal that each individual was
                            required to set up and log onto to view their pay information.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text--paragraph__bottom">
                            The challenge was to successfully communicate this major change to each and every associate so that they
                            were able to utilize resources for setting up their new account, as well as access their information
                            going forward. Not every associate had access to or familiarity with a computer, however it was
                            mandatory that 100% of the population had an account that they were able to use.
                        </p>
                        <h4 class="h4-lower-left">Solution</h4>
                        <p class="text--paragraph__bottom">
                            Myself and the Communications Manager worked closely on the campaign, coming up with a concept and
                            tagline and planning the campaign. From here, I developed the copy for the printed materials, and the
                            overall design with the graphic designer.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text--paragraph__bottom">
                            First, computers were set up in all stores and warehouses so that associates that did not already use a
                            computer on a daily basis would have access to one.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text--paragraph__bottom">
                            Second, I prepared pamphlets, postcards, and other written materials that outlined 'Frequently Asked
                            Questions' and detailed instructions on how to set up their new user account, as well as how to log in
                            regularly to view and print their pay stubs and tax forms.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text--paragraph__bottom">
                            I also prepared an overall approach for team leaders and managers that incorporated multiple
                            communication channels: manager talking points, posters, and promotional materials such as magnets and
                            pencils with the URL for the new portal. The message was an important one that needed to be successfully
                            communicated to every employee, so I also prepared a detailed release schedule for every piece of the
                            campaign over an eight week period.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text--paragraph__bottom">
                            In order to encourage immediate and maximum engagement in our initial sign-up period, an incentive
                            program was created for teams that had 100% enrollment status by a certain period.
