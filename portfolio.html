                            The 'Boosting your kraft-ability' quarterly magazine was created for the client as an engaging way to communicate the company's Health & Wellness portfolio to employees nationwide in both French and English. In order to reach every employee, whether they be in front of a computer or on the factory floor, I also prepared manager's notes for prompting discussion during team meetings and posters to be hung up in lunch rooms across Canada.

                            As chief editor and project manager, I began each year with an overall schedule for all issues. I prepared article concepts that were then fine-tuned, and myself or another writer would complete the full article. For several issues, I acted as the sole writer, including the Winter edition on the right. Download the PDF for a complete sample of my writing.

                            These printed materials were part of a change management campaign for a client with a diverse employee population, with an overall approach that incorporated multiple communication channels that would reach all employees in every location: manager talking points, posters and brochures, and promotional materials. The goal with these printed materials was to reach employees that didnâ€™t have regular access to a computer. The message was an important one that needed to be successfully communicated to every employee, so I also prepared a detailed release schedule for every piece of the campaign over an eight week period.

                            In order to better understand the feelings and perspectives of the client's retired employees, our team conducted a survey as well as a focus group on the topic of pension statements and how to best deliver information to retired employees in the future.

                            The client was keen to have a clear understanding of how the current publications, as well as the design, production and delivery of the annual pension statement were serving the retiree population. In order to explore the possibility of an online portal in the future, we also included questions to collect opinions and preferences around changes in the delivery of information via different technologies.

                            For all statement projects featured here, I have managed the full construction of the statement template and specifications documents. I also oversaw the entire process of production and distribution through to completion, directing a team of
                            colleagues as well as external vendors. For many of these clients, the statement project recurred over multiple years.
                        </p>

                            For this Total Rewards Statement project, the client had never before created a Total Rewards statement; I built the specifications document, corresponding data, and content from their pension and benefits package. The design template was created from scratch based on our own research and analysis of statement design.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text--paragraph__left text--paragraph__bottom">
                            The statement is made up of three main parts: on the front page is the header on the top half, and the five main sections on the bottom half. Specific plan information can be found on the back page. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="text--paragraph__left text--paragraph__bottom">
                            The header contains the most high-level information, such as the employee's name and their total rewards number. The second section holds more detailed information, breaking that high-level number down into five columns. Each column is colour-coded and assigned an icon for easy, fast identification. For those individuals that are interested in the fine print, the third section on the back page contains the finer details about each benefit.
                        </p>

                            For this pension statement, the client had been sending out the statement each year to their employees, however it was a simple Word file with no design features. It was difficult to read, drowning in actuarial pension jargon, and key information was buried.

                            The first thing to do was to put the most relevant information on the front page: how much money the employee had accumulated. On the second page, the template contains a bright purple box containing important beneficiary and employment information. All other pension information follows after this.

                            This client had been publishing their Total Rewards Statements for many years, but wanted to move the printed statement into a portal where employees could log in and view a PDF version.

                            We maintained the concept of the previous layout, with a summary on the first page that allowed the employee to see the total rewards number immediately, and a subsequent page for each section with more detailed information.
