                        For the three total reward statement projects featured here, the clients were keen to promote their full pension
                        and benefits package to their employees on an annual basis in order to encourage loyalty and retention within
                        their organization.

                        For this statement project, the client had never before created a total rewards statement for their employees. They were keen to present something that was short and concise to hold the interest of their audience without compromising on the quality of information being presented.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="h4-lower-left">Solution</h4>
                    <p class="text--paragraph__left text--paragraph__bottom">
                        The statement is made up of three main parts:
                    </p>
                    <p class="text--paragraph__left text--paragraph__bottom">
                        1/ At the top of the front page is the header, where the most important information to the user can be found: their name, address, and their total rewards number. This is the total amount of their salary, pension, and benefits for that year.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text--paragraph__bottom">
                        2/ Below the header are the five main sections that make up that total rewards number. Each column is colour-coded and assigned an icon for easy, fast identification. If the employee is interested, they can read each column to find specific information on what is included and how much the company contributed to their total number. At the bottom of each column is the amount for that section.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text--paragraph__bottom">
                        The fifth and final column doesn't actually contribute to the employee's total rewards number, however the client was keen to show the charities that the company, as well as the employees, were involved with throughout the year.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text--paragraph__bottom">
                        3/ Finally - if the employee is keen to read the very fine print, they can turn the page over and find the plan information for each benefit, laid out in the already-familiar colour-coded columns from the front page.

                        For this pension statement, the client had been sending out the statement each year to their employees, however it was a simple black & white document with no design features. It was difficult to read and drowning in actuarial pension jargon, subsequently burying the information that the employee cared most about.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text--paragraph__bottom">
                        Over the years the company had been acquired several times, resulting in nine different pension plans that each required complex programming and templates. We were keen to strip the content down so that the statement contained only the absolutely necessary information and hopefully reduce the
                        number of variations.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="h4-lower-left">Solution</h4>
                    <p class="text--paragraph__bottom">
                        1/ The first thing to do was to put the most relevant information on the front page. For the employees, that was how much money they had accumulated for their retirement over the past year. The cover page was adjusted so that it contained only the employee's name and address, the name of the pension plan(s) they were a part of, and a simple breakdown of their money.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text--paragraph__bottom">
                        2/ On the inside, the statement contained a bright purple box on the left side containing important beneficiary and employment information. Because we read from left to right, this ensured that it was the first thing the employee read when they opened up the statement. If there were any errors in this information, the employee was able to identify it right away and call HR to correct this. All other fine print pension information followed after this.

                    <p class="text--paragraph__bottom">
                        3/ The total rewards number was separated into five distinct sections and represented by a wave at the bottom of the page. Each piece of the wave was colour-coded and contained an amount that the employee had received for that section. Under that was their total rewards number, where all five sections were totalled.

                    <p class="text--paragraph__bottom">
                        4/ Each section was given a page in the document that corresponded to the colour in the wave on the front page, and outlined every benefit that the company offered. If the employee had taken advantage of that benefit, the monetary amount was listed.
